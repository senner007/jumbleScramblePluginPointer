Roadmap:

+ add margin for elt to constructor the first time it is calculated in animateback
+ setChars function should update elt object as well, it does not work when moving to another container. should probably work in conjunction with the relayout method.
+ Dragging enable/disable/lock on individual items method
+ shuffle method
+ test in slider
+ Multiple container drop ( long term )
+ Improve add and remove method. eg. all or an array as parameter, allow index(number) as elt selctor in removeLiElem
+ Add containment option to specify containment for the draggable elements.
+ Click items to delete (for showcasing)
+ working example where text is retrieved from json file with option to save
+ Add callbacks to init, relayout, add, remove, drop (before and after animate)
+ relayout is duplicating code from init - FIX ME!
+ add boolean to cutOffEnd method which prevents the function from running if the cut-off element(s) will make adjacent container fire its cutoffEnd method and thereby creating an infinite loop.
+ remove animAdded from prototype and add to animation module
+ Setup main page with Bulma css. Show all examples on one page and add a -show in full screen- link to each. Fetch each example module which are exporting objects with unique data.
  * Make examples avaiable using the routes rewrite in htaccess. When using the routes, remove anything but the example and show in full screen.
+ Assume transition support
+ Remove jQuery dependency - Pointer events polyfill will still work without it
+ Throttle the resize events
+ Call orientationChange event in place of resize on Chrome ios
+ use native event delegation https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14174056/native-addeventlistener-with-selector-like-on-in-jquery
+ trigger events using native js - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events
+ optionally implement logic to calculate animation speed based on the position of the dropped item relative to its new position
+ when using a single list, allow the option to constrain to a single axis - http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/touchevents.shtml(bottom)
+ maybe set {passive: true} as third argument on event start and event move - https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/01/scrolling-intervention
+ Put dirSwitch as property on instance dragging from and rename to crossTrigger,  rename crossTrigger to crossFlag and put on same instance.
+ add placeholder when dragging
+ allow jquery pointer polyfill as optional
+ crossDistance should be a property set on init/reLayout, not a method.
+ put elt object properties on namespaced separate object. Name the object dynamically to the div id.
+ pass in the element for the adjacent container on instantiation, and set/look up adjacent container by its id
  if id is not passed in options, it will assign a number based id based on the order of instantiation(default)
+ getInstances() should point to array of all instances but without prototypes (Object.assign)
+ fix lock method
+ support for custom animations set in options
+ method to turn all animations on/off
+ remove _transToZero from prototype
----------------------------
+ use the eltsReorder in addLiElem
