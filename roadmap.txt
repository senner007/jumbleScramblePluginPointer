Roadmap:
2.0
+ set up css in options overwritring the css in css file
+ optionally implement logic to calculate animation speed based on the position of the dropped item relative to its new position

0.2 - Plugin showcasing
+ Click items to delete (for showcasing)
+ Setup main page with Bulma css. Show all examples on one page and add a -show in full screen- link to each. Fetch each example module which are exporting objects with unique data.
  * Make examples avaiable using the routes rewrite in htaccess. When using the routes, remove anything but the example and show in full screen.
+ Throttle the resize events
+ support for custom animations set in options
+ method to turn all animations on/off
+ getInstances() should point to array of all instances but without prototypes (Object.assign)
+ Add callbacks to init, relayout, add, remove, drop (before and after animate)
+ Add containment option to specify containment for the draggable elements.
+ add placeholder when dragging
+ maybe set {passive: true} as third argument on event start and event move - https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/01/scrolling-intervention
+ if id is not passed in options, it will get the div id or assign a number based id based on the order of instantiation(default)
+ possibly eliminate the need for having both height and width property on elt.props

0.1
+ REname the plugin
+ Refactor shuffle method to scale out and in use the _scaleElems method, call cutoff method after shuffle
+ setChars function should update elt object as well, it does not work when moving to another container. should probably work in conjunction with the relayout method.
+ Dragging enable/disable/lock on individual items method
+ Improve add and remove method. eg. all or an array as parameter, allow index(number) as elt selctor in removeLiElem
+ add boolean to cutOffEnd method which prevents the function from running if the cut-off element(s) will make adjacent container fire its cutoffEnd method and thereby creating an infinite loop.
+ Assume transition support
+ replace $.extend with object.assign
+ Remove jQuery dependency - Pointer events polyfill will still work without it
+ Call orientationChange event in place of resize on Chrome ios
+ use native event delegation https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14174056/native-addeventlistener-with-selector-like-on-in-jquery
+ when using a single list, allow the option to constrain to a single axis - http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/touchevents.shtml(bottom)
+ allow jquery pointer polyfill as optional
--------------------------------------------------
+ fix onReorder event to only show reorder on the desired instance
+ fix lock method
+ call scale method in removeLiElem
+ allow option to cutoff to specified instance
+ recalculate adjInst(n).distanceTo & props.divWidth/divHeight on reLayout
+ allow shuffle method with no parameters, otherwise should take an array of instances
+ Use normalize.css
+ Allow vertical instances to be placed vertically above/under. Create example with 4 vertical instances aligned horizontally which then realigns to 2 above and 2 under in landscape mode.
+ Validate html with w3
+ Optional sorting functionality - drag from but not reorder
+ Put crossflag on instance object - not prototype
+ Set initial div.id on elt
+ return elt, elts, thisInst and thisInst.newInst with onDropTo, onDropFrom callbacks
+ allow user to specify delay before animating elements

Fixed:
+ allow dragging and dropping over other instances - Fixed
+ double cliking elements throws errors - Fixed
+ do not run init on object instantiation (run after as obj.init())- Fixed
+ currently doesn't work in Edge - Fixed ({once: true} in events doesn't agree with Edge)
+ improve the addLiElem logic, remove jQuery - DONE
+ maybe add and remove the element on triggeron/tiggeroff, hide it but update its position on each reorder. Then avoid calling the addLiElem on dragstop - DONE
+ try to unify the reordering logic and refactor into a single function call - DONE
+ remove global instanceArr. DONE
+ refactor cutOff - pass completeHeight, comleteWidth to addLiElem - DONE
+ on event move, pass in only instances that are involved in the event(Pass in elt, instanceThis, instanceAdj (maybe rename)). DONE
+ Put remaining properties on instanceArr on each instance. DONE
+ allow cutOff and dropLimit to be set after init - DONE
+ make dropLimit work in horizontal mode - DONE
+ refactor scale/descale elems to one function DONE
+ scale in items before transition has finished - DONE
+ make calculate a ul function - DONE
+ make a function to iterate  over elements and add to object as in init and relayout. -DONE
+ make cutOff return a collection of items and which can then be passed to add and remove function. DONE
+ make a cutoff on prototype only for external use - DONE
+ save the ul height on instance -DONE
+ remove onstop from prototype - Done
+ use the eltsReorder in addLiElem - then publish reorder event when reorder in eltsReorder functions - Done
+ relayout is duplicating code from init - DONE
+ reduce params to addToObject function - DONE
+ remove _transToZero from prototype -DONE
+ remove remaining methods from adjInst prototype - DONE
+ trigger events using native js - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events - DONE
+ account for margin/space  between instances - DONE
+ remove setInstances, addLiElem, removeLiElem from proto - DONE
+ fix shaking animation in edge - DONE (occurs when .container class position is not set to absolute in css)
+ pass in the element for the adjacent container on instantiation, and set/look up adjacent container by its id - DONE
+ No need to pass adjConElts and o to triggeroff function - DONE
+ loop over copy.adjInst(n) to be removed in setInstances -DONE
+ update algorithm to allow for individual width of adjacent vertical instances :
ThisInst.left + thisInst.w /2 > thisInst[p].left && ThisInst.left + thisInst.w /2 < thisInst[p] + thisInst[p].w -DONE
+ Use only one loop when setting divSwitch, save the position distance to a var and only run loop if outside the saved distance -DONE
+ recalculate completeHeight/completeWidth when adding element dragged from container with a different width - DONE
+ correct bug causing cutOff to not calculate properly - DONE
+ fix z-index - DONE
+ Multiple container drop ( long term ) - DONE
+ allow individual width of each instance in vertical -DONE
+ Setup with css grid - DONE
+ define getter and setter for position, size -DONE

Partially fixed:
+ prevent multitouch !!! - The element will freeze and animate back if multi touch is detected. Find a way to simple ignore additional touches

Testing:
+ Create responsive layout and test on mobile devices
+ Insert into sliders eg. SLY

Dependency:
jQuery ? - latest
jQuery pointer events polyfill
